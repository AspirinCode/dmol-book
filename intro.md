Deep Learning for Molecules and Materials
=================================================================

These are course notes for *Deep learning for molecules and materials* taught by Andrew White at the University of Rochester,
first offered in Fall 2020. They aspirationally make a "book."

## {doc}`Math Review <math/tensors-and-shapes>`

A review of tensors and how to use them.

## {doc}`Machine Learning <ml/introduction>`

An overview of machine learning. Concepts include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, features, regression, classification, kernel methods, and statistical learning theory.

## {doc}`Deep Learning <dl/introduction>`

The main topics of the book.

### Neural Networks

MLP, classification

### Layers

Dense, embeddings, convolutions, pooling

### Training

Boss functions, backprop, minimization

### Applied Deep learning
